Moderator perspective
=====

Moderators (conveners) are users with special access level. You simply need to register and sign in with your Indico convener email.
Once logged in you would gain access to special features.
You have to go to the details of a presentation and if you had signed in with your convener email,
then a special "Moderator View" button will appear in the "Moderator Control" card.

Moderator control
-----------------
It is not unusual when a presentation actually starts with a delay or ahead of schedule.
When an attendee is interested in such a presentation chanses are them might not join the desired presentation on time
because they would not know when it actually started.

Moderator Control is the place where a moderator could start and end a presentation dynamically so the attendees would know the actual start time.
Presentations with dynamically overriden schedule are presented to the attendees like in the following screenshot.
