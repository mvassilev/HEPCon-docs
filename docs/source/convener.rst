Convener perspective
=====

Conveners are users with special access level. You simply need to register and sign in with your Indico convener email. Once logged in you would gain access to special features.
You have to go to the details of a presentation and if you had signed in with your convener email a special "Moderator View" button will appear in the "Moderator Control" card.
